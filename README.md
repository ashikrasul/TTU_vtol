This repository contrains the cad files and images from fixed-wing to QuadPlane conversion. 

The main airframe is 2.4m wingspan Voluntex Ranger 2400. We redesigned the avitionis, wings, propeller mountings to accomodate sensors for perception and edge device such as NVIDIA jetson orin nano to process machine learning models. 

The work is going to be published at AIAA SchiTech 2026. 

Details is coming soon...
